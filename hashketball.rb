##Helper method that does most of the iterations to retrieve team info at various level
def team_info(player_name='')
 players_and_stats = []
 all_stats_array=[]
 game_hash.each do |team, team_details|
   yield team_details if block_given? # This will yield team_details hash for calling methods that need team info.
   if team_details.is_a?(Hash)
      team_details.each do |team_identifier_name, team_identifier_value|
        if team_identifier_value.is_a?(Hash)
           team_identifier_value.each do |stats_name,stats_value|
             players_and_stats << [stats_name,stats_value]
           end
         end
       end
     end
 end


 if player_name.empty?
   players_and_stats.each_with_index do |ele, i|
      all_stats_array << players_and_stats[i][1] #This will return an array of hashes of all players
   end
   return all_stats_array
 else
   players_and_stats.each_with_index do |ele|

     return ele.last if ele.first == player_name ##this will return a hash of statistics for a given player
   end

 end

end


##Implementing scores retrieval methods
def num_points_scored(player_name)
  binding.pry
 team_info(player_name)[:points]
end


##Implementing Shoe size
def shoe_size(player_name)
 team_info(player_name)[:shoe]
end



##Implementing team_colors method
def team_colors(team_name)
  team_info do |team_details| #calling team_info method with do block. This will receive team details hash yielded by the method.
    if team_details[:team_name] == team_name
      return team_details[:colors]
    end
  end
end


##Implementing team names
def team_names
  teams=[]
  team_info do |team_details|
    teams << team_details[:team_name]
  end
  return teams
end


##Implementing player_numbers
def player_numbers(team_name)
  jersey_nums = []
  team_info do |team_details|
    if team_details[:team_name] == team_name
      team_details[:players].values.each {|num| jersey_nums << num[:number]}
    end
  end
 return jersey_nums
end


##Implementing player_stats
def player_stats(name)
 team_info(name)
end


#Implementing Big shoe rebound
def big_shoe_rebounds
team_info.max_by {|h| h[:shoe]}[:rebounds]#h[:shoe] returns a hash of stats with the biggest shoe size
end


###Bonus exercises

#Find most_points_scored
def most_points_scored
  max_points = team_info.max_by {|stats_hash|stats_hash[:points]}
  team_info do |team_details|
    team_details[:players].each do |player, stats|
      return player if stats == max_points
    end
  end

end


##helper method for winning_team method to find the total scores of each team
def find_total_scores(team_details)
  total_scores = 0
  team_details[:players].values.each do |stats|
    total_scores += stats[:points]
  end
  return total_scores
end



##winning_team
def winning_team
  team_scores = Hash.new
  team_info do |team_details|
    team_scores[team_details[:team_name]] = find_total_scores(team_details)
  end
  team_scores.max_by {|team, score|score}.first
end

## returns player name with longest characters.
def player_with_longest_name
  longest_name = ""
  team_info do |team_details|
    team_details[:players]
    .keys
    .each do |player_name|
      if player_name.length > longest_name.length
        longest_name = player_name
      end
    end

  end
  return longest_name
end

##returns true or false  if longest name steals a ton
def long_name_steals_a_ton?
  highest_steals_players = nil
  team_info do |team_details|
    highest_steals_players= team_details[:players].key(team_info.max_by {|stats_hash|stats_hash[:steals]})
  end
  highest_steals_players == player_with_longest_name
end
